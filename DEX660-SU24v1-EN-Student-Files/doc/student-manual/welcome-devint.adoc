== {INTRO} the course

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course is for developers who have already internalized the basics of creating {MApps} with {Studio} and {AP} and now want to apply these skills in the context of professional software development projects, creating production-ready integrations.

[[course-goals]]
=== Course goals and objectives

{COBJ}

* Invoke REST APIs and SOAP web services using various client components taking into consideration the nonfunctional properties of {APIInvs}.
* Pass messages asynchronously reliably between Mule flows and Mule apps using the VM and {AMQ} connectors.
* Assert contracts within and between {MFlows} using the validation module and JSON/XML schema validation.
* Apply common Enterprise Integration Patterns to orchestrate and parallelize integration logic.
* Use the Object Store and related components to manage state for {MApps} and {APIs} to increase performance and resilience.
* Identify and extract reusable {MApp} code into different Mule runtime extensions.
* Extract reusable integration functionality into {XMLSDKMods} and custom {APolicies}.
