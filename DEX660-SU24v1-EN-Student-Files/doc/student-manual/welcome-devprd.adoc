== {INTRO} the course

//--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This course is for developers who have already internalized the basics of creating {MApps} with {Studio} and {AP} and now want to apply these skills in the context of professional software development projects, creating production-ready {MApps}.
//This course is the first in a family of courses — {CourseFamily} — which helps students reach this second level of {AP} development expertise.

In this course, students focus on configuration, build, test, and deployment of {MApps} following these themes:

* Automation with {MVN}-based tooling of build, unit-test and deployment of {MApps}.
* Full lifecycle, multi-environment configuration and deployment.
* Unit-testing with {MUnit}.
* Security: data protection at rest (in {MApp} configuration files and {ARM}) and in transit (using HTTPS).
* Monitoring and observability of {MApps} through health checks and operational logging.
* Coding standards and naming conventions.

In covering these topics, this course teaches the foundations for applying a DevOps mindset to {MApp} development projects — but it does not cover DevOps or CI/CD in itself, it only lays the necessary foundation.

//The case study used in this course ({AA}), its solution, and the GitHub repository through which it is distributed are common to the entire course family.
