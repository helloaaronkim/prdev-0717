# Creates an asset for the student manual of the devint-course (APDevPRInts) based on the current state of this repo.
# This asset is intended for a new release of this course and 
# is created as a PDF file in the assets sub-directory of the current directory.
#
# The asset name will include the Mule runtime version this course release is based on
# as well as the current date (in format 07may2020). Both of these are determined automatically.
#
# Outputs to stderr the name of the asset file (which was created in the assets sub-directory):
# APDevPRInts4.3_studentManual_07may2020.pdf
#
# Assumes that the student manual is already built and committed to GitHub
# and can therefore be run from a fresh clone of this GitHub project.

# Usage: create-student-manual-asset-for-devint.sh
